        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p><i>The Ramble</i> is a group bike ride kicking off in Kalamazoo in the <strong>Spring of 2024</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>What kind of ride?</h2>
        <p>At it's core, <i>The Ramble</i> is just a bike ride with some friends you haven't met yet.</p>
        <p>We won't be smashing PRs, shredding singletrack, or really getting anywhere too fast.</p>
        <p>Routes will typically be 15-20 miles in length, getting off the beaten path and exploring unique terrain whenever possible.</p>
        <p>Meet up, go for a ride, and finish with some refreshments. Simple.</p>

        <h2>What sort of bike do I need?</h2>
        <p>The spirit of <i>The Ramble</i> is that there are no real rules. If your bike can carry you the distance of the ride, and you enjoy riding it, then you're on the right bike.</p>
        <p>We like steel frames, old mountain bikes, gravel bikes, dusty garage klunkers, <i>whatever</i>.</p>
        <p>Finally, I'm definitely not a <i>lycra</i> guy, and this is certainly not a <i>lycra</i> type of ride. Come as you are.</p>

        <h2>How do I get involved?</h2>
        <p>If you're on Strava, hit the button above to join <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/ramblekzoo">The Ramble Strava club</a>. Events will be created and routes will be shared here.</p>
        <p>You can also add your email to the mailing list by submitting the form above. In case you're not a Strava user, I'll be sure to send out links to events and routes via email as well.</p>

        <h2>Whose idea was this?</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Graham ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>I'm a metro Detroit native, but have called Kalamazoo home for the last 3 years. <i>The Ramble</i> represents the sort of rides that I most enjoy going on with friends back home.</p>
        <p>If you'd like, you can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/graham.bewley">follow me on Instagram</a>, where I'll be sharing more details as the season of warmth approaches and routes are finalized.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to rambling with you!</p>
